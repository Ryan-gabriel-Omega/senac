            <h3>Combat Arms Developer Blog</h3>

            <p>The Combat Arms Developer Blog is a monthly message to players from various Nexon Staff. The message
                usually involves in-depth, secret detail of the development of certain things, including maps, gear and
                game modes.</p>

                <h2> System Improvements </h2>
                <p>We realize that allowing only 1 set of Daily Jobs may have felt restrictive, so we’ve removed the
                    daily
                    limit entirely!

                    Multiple Daily Jobs will be provided, and users will be able to choose the jobs they want to take on
                    from the list. In addition to 3-Step Consecutive Daily Jobs, the new system will also provide
                    one-time
                    jobs with only one step. The only restriction is that players can only take on one job at a time.

                    We’re also adding a Daily Job pop-up menu to make it easier to find available Daily Jobs for the day
                    when you log in. This menu can be turned off if you find it obtrusive.</p>

                <h2>General UI Improvements</h2>

                <p>With the addition of our lovely new job operator, we've streamlined the interface and removed some
                    unnecessary features.

                    The three job categories will remain the same: "Available," "Current," and "Completed." Click each
                    tab
                    to review the details and rewards associated with your jobs.</p>

                <h2>Enhanced Scenarios</h2>

                <p>The New Job Operator serves as your secretary, managing not only your Daily Jobs, but all of your
                    Jobs.
                    Clients who wish to hire you will send a request message, and you’ll be able to accept the Job
                    through
                    the Job Operator.

                    There will be a variety of interesting clients, and their requests will lead to exciting scenarios.

                <h2>Cosmetic Item Shop</h2>

                <p>We're also introducing a new Cosmetic Item Shop.


                    1/3
                    This is where you can go to customize your character's appearance. Whereas gear items focus on
                    enhancing
                    stats, cosmetic items are solely for looks and setting your character apart from the crowd. When
                    choosing body gear, players often had to decide between looks and functionality, but with Cosmetic
                    Items, you can have both.

                    It doesn’t matter if your best gear is ugly. Simply equip cosmetic items to give your character a
                    whole
                    new look! With the increased number of choices for customizing gear, Clan leaders will be able to
                    choose
                    clan gear that everyone likes.

                    Cosmetic items are equipped just like gear. If you like the 7% movement speed boost you get from
                    your
                    helmet slot item but don’t like its look, equip a new cosmetic item in the cosmetic head slot to
                    change
                    its appearance.

                    Cosmetic Items can also provide a tactical advantage. There are certain times when you’ll want to
                    hide
                    the information and stats of your gear by disguising it with Cosmetic Items.

                    Check out concept images for some of the new cosmetic items.

                    All this is coming your way in the September update! Thank you for playing Combat Arms, and enjoy
                    all
                    the newest additions!

                    See you on the battlefield!</p>
